# Next5racesApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.

## To run the Angular app

1. Open folder **next5races-app** in VSCode.
2. Open a Terminal from Menu Item View->Terminal: 
    *   npm install 
    *   ng serve
3. Navigate to http://localhost:4200 in the browser.
4. Implementaion screenhot is also provided.

## To improve on
* Name should be refactored to NextRacesApp as no. of races being displayed is determined by no. of races sent back by API
* Use proper SVG instead of JPG files and register with Material Design
* Implement Routing and move the nextrace implementaion to its own component
* Implement Home Landing Page and Nrowsin
* Implement Breadcrumbs
* Check if multiple calls to refresh data from API leads to memory leak and unsubsrbie if required.
* Move constants to a coonfig file like URL, Race Types ENUM.
